                <h2>American Neutrality and Path to War (1939-1941)</h2>
                <p>When World War II began in Europe in September 1939, the United States initially maintained a policy of neutrality. However, President Roosevelt believed that a Nazi victory would threaten American security, and he gradually moved the country toward supporting the Allies while trying to avoid direct military involvement.</p>

                <div class="key-points">
                    <h3>Key Steps Toward Involvement</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Cash and Carry (1939):</strong> Allowed Allies to purchase American arms if they paid cash and transported goods themselves</li>
                        <li><strong>Destroyers for Bases Deal (1940):</strong> The US traded 50 aging destroyers to Britain in exchange for land rights to build bases</li>
                        <li><strong>Lend-Lease Act (March 1941):</strong> Allowed the US to "lend" war materials to any nation deemed vital to American defense</li>
                        <li><strong>Atlantic Charter (August 1941):</strong> Joint declaration by Roosevelt and Churchill outlining post-war aims</li>
                        <li><strong>Undeclared Naval War (Fall 1941):</strong> US Navy escorted British ships and exchanged fire with German submarines</li>
                    </ul>

                    <p>"Yesterday, December 7, 1941—a date which will live in infamy—the United States of America was suddenly and deliberately attacked by naval and air forces of the Empire of Japan."</p>

                <h2>Pearl Harbor and American Entry into the War</h2>
                <p>The Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor on December 7, 1941, shattered American isolationism and brought the United States fully into World War II. The surprise attack devastated the Pacific Fleet, killing 2,403 Americans and wounding 1,178. The next day, Congress declared war on Japan, and on December 11, Germany and Italy declared war on the United States.</p>

                <p>World War II transformed the American economy and society. The massive industrial mobilization finally ended the Great Depression and reshaped American society in fundamental ways:</p>

                    <p>Significant American turning points in World War II include Pearl Harbor (bringing the US into the war), the Battle of Midway (June 1942, turning the tide in the Pacific), D-Day (June 6, 1944, opening the Western Front in Europe), and the development of the atomic bomb (ending the war with Japan).

                <h2>The Manhattan Project and Atomic Bombings</h2>
                <p>Fearing that Nazi Germany might develop an atomic weapon, the United States launched the top-secret Manhattan Project in 1942 to develop nuclear weapons. By 1945, Germany had surrendered, but the project continued with a focus on ending the war with Japan.</p>

                <p>On August 6, 1945, the United States dropped an atomic bomb on Hiroshima, Japan, killing approximately 80,000 people instantly. Three days later, a second bomb was dropped on Nagasaki. On August 15, Japan surrendered, ending World War II.</p>
