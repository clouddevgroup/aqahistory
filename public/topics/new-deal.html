                <h2>Franklin D. Roosevelt and the First New Deal (1933-1934)</h2>
                <p>Franklin D. Roosevelt was elected president in 1932 with a promise of a "New Deal" for the American people. His inauguration in March 1933 came at the depths of the Great Depression, with 13 million unemployed and the banking system on the verge of collapse. Roosevelt's first 100 days in office saw an unprecedented flurry of legislation that fundamentally transformed the relationship between the American government and its citizens.</p>

                <div class="key-points">
                    <h3>Key Initiatives of the First New Deal</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Banking Reform:</strong> The Emergency Banking Act (March 1933) stabilized the banking system, while the Glass-Steagall Act separated commercial and investment banking</li>
                        <li><strong>Agricultural Adjustment Act (AAA):</strong> Paid farmers to reduce production to raise prices, though later declared unconstitutional</li>
                        <li><strong>Civilian Conservation Corps (CCC):</strong> Employed 3 million young men in environmental conservation projects</li>
                        <li><strong>Tennessee Valley Authority (TVA):</strong> Regional development program that built dams, produced electricity, and modernized one of America's poorest regions</li>
                        <li><strong>National Industrial Recovery Act (NIRA):</strong> Created the Public Works Administration (PWA) and established codes of fair practice for industry</li>
                    </ul>
                </div>

                <div class="date-section">
                    <div class="date">
                        <h4>1933</h4>
                        <p>"The only thing we have to fear is fear itself" - FDR's inaugural address</p>
                    </div>
                </div>

                <h2>The Second New Deal (1935-1938)</h2>
                <p>By 1935, Roosevelt faced criticism from both the left and right. The Supreme Court had declared several New Deal programs unconstitutional, and critics like Huey Long demanded more radical redistribution of wealth. In response, Roosevelt launched a second wave of reforms that were more far-reaching and had longer-lasting impacts on American society.</p>

                <div class="key-points">
                    <h3>Key Initiatives of the Second New Deal</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Works Progress Administration (WPA):</strong> Employed 8.5 million Americans building public infrastructure including schools, hospitals, and roads</li>
                        <li><strong>Social Security Act (1935):</strong> Created a pension system for retired workers, unemployment insurance, and aid for dependent children and the disabled</li>
                        <li><strong>National Labor Relations Act (Wagner Act):</strong> Guaranteed workers' right to unionize and collectively bargain</li>
                        <li><strong>Fair Labor Standards Act (1938):</strong> Established the minimum wage and banned child labor</li>
                        <li><strong>Rural Electrification Administration:</strong> Brought electricity to rural America, improving living standards for millions</li>
                    </ul>
                </div>

                <h2>Opposition to the New Deal</h2>
                <p>Despite its popularity, the New Deal faced significant opposition from multiple sources:</p>

                <table class="data-table">
                    <tr>
                        <th>Group</th>
                        <th>Criticisms</th>

                    <tr>
                        <td>Republicans &amp; Business Leaders</td>
                        <td>Claimed the New Deal was socialism, created too much government control, and undermined free enterprise</td>
                    </tr>
                    <tr>
                        <td>The Supreme Court</td>
                        <td>Declared key programs unconstitutional (e.g., NRA and AAA), leading to Roosevelt's controversial "court-packing" plan</td>
                    </tr>
                    <tr>
                        <td>Populists (Huey Long)</td>
                        <td>Argued the New Deal didn't go far enough in redistributing wealth, proposing the "Share Our Wealth" program</td>
                    </tr>
                    <tr>
                        <td>Conservatives (Father Coughlin)</td>
                        <td>Initially supported but later turned against the New Deal, using radio broadcasts to attack Roosevelt</td>
                    </tr>
                </table>

                <h2>Impact and Legacy</h2>
                <p>The New Deal did not end the Great Depression—World War II would ultimately bring full employment—but it fundamentally transformed American society and government in ways that continue to shape life today:</p>

                            <li>African Americans received limited benefits and faced discrimination in programs</li>
                            <li>Some programs reinforced traditional gender roles</li>
                            <li>Agricultural policies benefited large landowners over tenant farmers</li>
                            <li>Created tension between executive and judicial branches</li>

                    <h3>Exam Focus: Historical Interpretations</h3>
                    <p>The New Deal remains a subject of historical debate. Liberal historians like Arthur Schlesinger Jr. view it as a necessary adaptation of government to modern economic conditions, while conservative historians like Burton Folsom argue it prolonged the Depression by interfering with market mechanisms. Recent scholarship by historians like Ira Katznelson emphasizes how the New Deal's benefits were often directed toward white Americans while excluding African Americans and other minorities. In your exam answers, consider these different perspectives.</p>
