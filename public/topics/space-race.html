                <h2>Origins and Early Soviet Achievements (1955-1958)</h2>
                <p>The Space Race emerged as a critical front in the Cold War as both superpowers sought to demonstrate their technological and scientific superiority. The competition began in earnest in the mid-1950s when both the United States and Soviet Union announced plans to launch artificial satellites as part of the International Geophysical Year (1957-1958).</p>

                <div class="key-points">
                    <h3>Early Soviet Triumphs</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Sputnik 1 (October 4, 1957):</strong> World's first artificial satellite, a 23-inch diameter sphere that orbited Earth for three months</li>
                        <li><strong>Sputnik 2 (November 3, 1957):</strong> Carried Laika, the first animal in orbit (though she died within hours)</li>
                        <li><strong>Luna 1 (January 1959):</strong> First spacecraft to escape Earth's gravity and orbit the sun</li>
                        <li><strong>Luna 2 (September 1959):</strong> First spacecraft to impact the moon</li>
                        <li><strong>Luna 3 (October 1959):</strong> First images of the far side of the moon</li>
                    </ul>
                </div>

                <div class="quote-box">
                    <p>"Soon they will be dropping bombs on us from space like kids dropping rocks onto cars from freeway overpasses."</p>

                </div>

                <h2>The American Response: The "Sputnik Crisis" (1957-1958)</h2>
                <p>The successful launch of Sputnik created a sense of crisis in the United States. Americans feared that Soviet space capabilities indicated military superiority, especially in missile technology. The "Sputnik Crisis" led to significant changes in American scientific, educational, and defense policy.</p>

                <div class="key-points">
                    <h3>American Responses to Sputnik</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>NASA Created (1958):</strong> National Aeronautics and Space Administration established to coordinate civilian space efforts</li>
                        <li><strong>National Defense Education Act (1958):</strong> Federal funding for education in science, mathematics, and foreign languages</li>
                        <li><strong>Explorer 1 (January 31, 1958):</strong> First successful American satellite, discovered the Van Allen radiation belts</li>
                        <li><strong>Advanced Research Projects Agency (1958):</strong> Created to develop cutting-edge military technology (later became DARPA)</li>
                        <li><strong>Accelerated ICBM Development:</strong> Atlas and Titan missile programs received additional funding</li>
                    </ul>

                <h2>The Human Space Flight Race (1961-1963)</h2>
                <p>The competition intensified with the race to put a human in space. Again, the Soviet Union achieved the first milestone with Yuri Gagarin's historic flight, but the United States soon followed with its own achievements.</p>

                <p>On May 25, 1961, President Kennedy made a bold declaration before Congress, committing the United States to "landing a man on the moon and returning him safely to Earth" before the end of the decade. This ambitious goal redirected the Space Race toward lunar exploration.</p>
