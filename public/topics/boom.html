                <h2>The American Economy in the 1920s</h2>
                <p>Following World War I, the United States experienced unprecedented economic growth. Industrial output increased by 60% between 1919 and 1929, and the national wealth almost doubled. This period of prosperity became known as the "Roaring Twenties" or the "Economic Boom."</p>

                <div class="key-points">
                    <h3>Key Statistics</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li>GDP grew from $69.6 billion in 1920 to $103.6 billion in 1929</li>
                        <li>Unemployment fell to around 3% by the mid-1920s</li>
                        <li>Car ownership rose from 8 million in 1920 to 23 million by 1929</li>
                        <li>Average wages for industrial workers rose by about 8% during the decade</li>
                    </ul>
                </div>

                <h2>Causes of the Economic Boom</h2>
                
                <h3>1. Mass Production</h3>
                <p>Henry Ford revolutionized manufacturing with the moving assembly line at his automobile factories. This approach dramatically reduced the time and cost to produce a car, making the Model T affordable for many American families. By 1925, Ford was producing a car every 10 seconds. Mass production techniques spread to other industries, increasing efficiency and reducing costs across the economy.</p>

                <h3>2. The Automobile Industry</h3>
                <p>The automobile industry was central to the boom. By 1929, one in five Americans owned a car. The industry created numerous jobs directly, but its impact extended much further. It stimulated growth in:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Supporting industries:</strong> Steel, glass, rubber, and petroleum all expanded rapidly</li>
                    <li><strong>Construction:</strong> New roads, highways, and bridges were built across the country</li>
                    <li><strong>Retail:</strong> Gas stations, motels, and roadside restaurants developed</li>
                    <li><strong>Suburban development:</strong> Cars enabled people to live further from city centers</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>3. New Consumer Goods</h3>
                <p>The 1920s saw the introduction and mass production of many new electrical appliances:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Refrigerators (ownership increased from 5,000 in 1921 to 1.5 million by 1929)</li>
                    <li>Vacuum cleaners</li>
                    <li>Washing machines</li>
                    <li>Radios (60% of American homes had one by 1929)</li>
                </ul>
                <p>These products transformed daily life, particularly for women, and created new manufacturing jobs.</p>

                <h3>4. Credit and Advertising</h3>
                <p>Two innovations helped Americans purchase the new consumer goods:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Hire purchase (buying on credit):</strong> Allowed consumers to pay in installments. By 1929, 60% of cars and 80% of radios were bought on credit.</li>
                    <li><strong>Advertising:</strong> Companies invested heavily in advertising to create demand for their products. Advertising spending increased from $1.4 billion in 1919 to $3.4 billion by 1929.</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>5. Government Policies</h3>
                <p>Republican administrations (Harding, Coolidge, and Hoover) pursued policies that favored business:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>High tariffs:</strong> The Fordney-McCumber Tariff (1922) and Hawley-Smoot Tariff (1930) protected American goods from foreign competition</li>
                    <li><strong>Tax cuts:</strong> Secretary of the Treasury Andrew Mellon reduced top income tax rates from 73% to 25%</li>
                    <li><strong>Non-interference:</strong> The government practiced "laissez-faire," allowing businesses to operate with minimal regulation</li>
                </ul>

                <div class="key-points">
                    <h3>Exam Tip</h3>
                    <p>When discussing the economic boom, make sure you can explain the relationships between different factors. For example, the automobile industry stimulated growth in other sectors, while hire purchase allowed more Americans to buy cars. These interconnections are important for higher-mark questions.</p>

                <h2>Social and Cultural Changes in the 1920s</h2>

                <h3>1. The Changing Role of Women</h3>
                <p>The 1920s saw significant changes in women's lives and social status:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Suffrage:</strong> The 19th Amendment (1920) gave women the right to vote</li>
                    <li><strong>The "New Woman":</strong> The "flapper" represented a new female identityâ€”young women with short hair, shorter skirts, who smoked, wore makeup, and embraced jazz music and dancing</li>
                    <li><strong>Employment:</strong> Women's participation in the workforce increased, though mainly in "female" occupations like teaching, nursing, and secretarial work</li>
                    <li><strong>Domestic life:</strong> New household appliances reduced some domestic burdens</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>2. Entertainment and Leisure</h3>
                <p>Americans had more disposable income and more free time:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Cinema:</strong> 100 million Americans went to the movies each week by 1929</li>
                    <li><strong>Radio:</strong> The first commercial radio station, KDKA, began broadcasting in 1920</li>
                    <li><strong>Sports:</strong> Baseball became hugely popular, with Babe Ruth as a national hero</li>
                    <li><strong>Jazz Age:</strong> Jazz music moved from African American communities to mainstream popularity</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>3. Tensions and Contradictions</h3>
                <p>Despite prosperity, American society faced significant tensions:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Prohibition:</strong> The 18th Amendment (1919) banned the production and sale of alcohol, leading to bootlegging and organized crime</li>
                    <li><strong>Immigration restriction:</strong> The Emergency Quota Act (1921) and National Origins Act (1924) severely restricted immigration, particularly from Southern and Eastern Europe</li>
                    <li><strong>Racial discrimination:</strong> African Americans faced continued segregation and discrimination, while the Ku Klux Klan reached its peak membership of 4-5 million in the mid-1920s</li>
                    <li><strong>Rural-urban divide:</strong> While cities boomed, agricultural areas faced economic hardship throughout the decade</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>4. Unequal Distribution of Wealth</h3>
                <p>The prosperity of the 1920s was not shared equally:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>The richest 1% of Americans owned 40% of the nation's wealth</li>
                    <li>60% of American families lived on less than $2,000 per year (the minimum needed for basic necessities)</li>
                    <li>Agricultural workers and coal miners suffered from low prices and wages</li>
                    <li>African Americans and recent immigrants typically held lower-paying jobs</li>
                </ul>
                <p>This inequality would become more problematic after the Wall Street Crash of 1929.</p>

                <div class="key-points">
                    <h3>Exam Application</h3>
                    <p>For 12-16 mark questions, a nuanced answer would consider both the positive and negative aspects of the 1920s economy. The headline growth figures mask significant economic problems that contributed to the eventual crash, such as overproduction, over-reliance on credit, agricultural depression, and unequal distribution of wealth.</p>
                </div>

                <h2>Key Historical Interpretations</h2>
                <p>Historians have offered various interpretations of the 1920s boom:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Traditional view:</strong> The 1920s represented a period of genuine prosperity and modernization that transformed American life before the economic disaster of the Depression</li>
                    <li><strong>Revisionist view:</strong> The boom contained fundamental weaknesses (overproduction, speculation, inequality) that made a crash inevitable</li>
                    <li><strong>Social historians:</strong> Emphasize how the benefits of the boom were unevenly distributed along lines of class, race, gender, and geography</li>
                    <li><strong>Cultural historians:</strong> Focus on how consumer culture and mass media created a more homogeneous national culture during this period</li>
                </ul>
