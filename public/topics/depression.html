                <h2>The Wall Street Crash</h2>
                <p>The Wall Street Crash of October 1929 marked the beginning of the Great Depression, the most severe economic downturn in modern American history. On "Black Thursday" (October 24) and "Black Tuesday" (October 29), stock prices collapsed, wiping out billions of dollars in wealth almost overnight.</p>

                <div class="key-points">
                    <h3>Key Statistics</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Stock prices fell by 40% in October 1929</li>
                        <li>By 1932, the Dow Jones Industrial Average had fallen from a high of 381 in September 1929 to just 41.22 (a 89% fall)</li>
                        <li>$30 billion (equivalent to over $500 billion today) in stock value was lost within weeks</li>
                        <li>16 million shares were traded on Black Tuesday alone</li>
                    </ul>
                </div>

                <h2>Causes of the Wall Street Crash</h2>
                
                <h3>1. Speculation and Margin Buying</h3>
                <p>During the 1920s, stock prices rose dramatically as more Americans invested in the stock market. Many investors bought stocks "on margin," meaning they put down as little as 10% of the stock's value and borrowed the rest from their brokers. This created a dangerous situation:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>If stock prices fell, investors would receive "margin calls" requiring them to provide more money</li>
                    <li>If they couldn't pay, their stocks would be sold, driving prices down further</li>
                    <li>This created a vicious cycle of forced selling and plummeting prices</li>
                </ul>
                <p>By September 1929, stock prices had become divorced from the actual value of the companies they represented. For example, RCA's stock price rose from $85 to $420 per share despite the company not paying any dividends.</p>

                <h3>2. Overproduction</h3>
                <p>American factories and farms were producing more goods than consumers could afford to buy:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Industrial production increased by 40% in the 1920s, but wages only rose by about 8%</li>
                    <li>Agricultural production remained high after WWI, but European demand fell as their farms recovered, leading to price collapses</li>
                    <li>By 1929, unsold inventories were increasing, and companies began to cut production and lay off workers</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>3. Unequal Distribution of Wealth</h3>
                <p>The prosperity of the 1920s was not shared equally:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>The richest 5% of Americans received approximately one-third of all income</li>
                    <li>About 60% of families earned less than $2,000 per year, below the level needed for basic necessities</li>
                    <li>This inequality meant that most Americans lacked the purchasing power to sustain economic growth</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>4. Banking System Weaknesses</h3>
                <p>The American banking system had several structural weaknesses:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>There were over 25,000 small, independent banks with limited reserves</li>
                    <li>No federal deposit insurance existed to protect customers' savings</li>
                    <li>Many banks engaged in risky investment practices, using customers' deposits to speculate in the stock market</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>5. Government Policies</h3>
                <p>Republican administrations pursued policies that may have contributed to the crash:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>High tariffs (Fordney-McCumber in 1922 and later Hawley-Smoot in 1930) reduced international trade</li>
                    <li>The Federal Reserve raised interest rates in 1928-29, hoping to curb speculation but making borrowing more expensive</li>
                    <li>The "laissez-faire" approach meant minimal regulation of banks and the stock market</li>
                </ul>

                <div class="key-points">
                    <h3>Exam Tip</h3>
                    <p>For "explain the causes" questions, make sure to show how different factors were interconnected. For example, explain how overproduction was linked to the unequal distribution of wealth, or how speculation was enabled by weak banking regulations.</p>
                </div>

                <h2>The Great Depression</h2>

                <h3>1. Economic Impact</h3>
                <p>The Crash triggered a devastating economic depression:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>GDP:</strong> Fell by 30% between 1929 and 1933</li>
                    <li><strong>Unemployment:</strong> Rose from 3% to 25% (around 15 million Americans) by 1933</li>
                    <li><strong>Industrial production:</strong> Fell by 45% between 1929 and 1932</li>
                    <li><strong>Bank failures:</strong> Over 9,000 banks failed between 1930 and 1933, wiping out millions of dollars in savings</li>
                    <li><strong>Deflation:</strong> Prices fell by about 25%, making debt repayment more difficult</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>2. Social Impact</h3>
                <p>The Depression had profound effects on American society:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Homelessness:</strong> Thousands of people lived in makeshift communities called "Hoovervilles" (named mockingly after President Hoover)</li>
                    <li><strong>Hunger:</strong> Malnutrition became common, with people standing in "bread lines" for free food</li>
                    <li><strong>Migration:</strong> Many families moved in search of work, particularly from the Dust Bowl states to California</li>
                    <li><strong>Family stress:</strong> Divorce rates actually fell (as people couldn't afford divorces), but desertion increased, and the marriage and birth rates declined</li>
                    <li><strong>Health issues:</strong> Suicide rates increased, and many people could not afford medical care</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>3. Dust Bowl</h3>
                <p>Environmental disaster compounded economic problems in the Great Plains:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Years of poor farming practices had damaged the soil</li>
                    <li>Severe drought struck in the early 1930s</li>
                    <li>Massive dust storms destroyed crops and made life unbearable</li>
                    <li>Hundreds of thousands of people (often called "Okies," though they came from multiple states) migrated to California</li>
                </ul>

                <h2>Hoover's Response</h2>
                <p>President Herbert Hoover's response to the Depression was limited by his political philosophy:</p>

                <h3>1. Initial Approach</h3>
                <p>Hoover believed in "rugged individualism" and limited government:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>He insisted the economy would recover naturally</li>
                    <li>He encouraged voluntary efforts by businesses and charities rather than direct government aid</li>
                    <li>He feared that direct federal assistance would make people dependent on government</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>2. Limited Measures</h3>
                <p>As the Depression worsened, Hoover did take some actions:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Federal Farm Board:</strong> Attempted to stabilize agricultural prices</li>
                    <li><strong>Reconstruction Finance Corporation (RFC):</strong> Provided loans to banks, railroads, and other businesses</li>
                    <li><strong>Home Loan Bank Act:</strong> Created institutions to provide home financing</li>
                    <li><strong>Emergency Relief and Construction Act:</strong> Provided some loans for public works projects</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>3. Limitations and Failures</h3>
                <p>Hoover's measures were inadequate for several reasons:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>They focused on helping institutions rather than individuals</li>
                    <li>The scale of funding was too small relative to the economic collapse</li>
                    <li>Aid often didn't reach those who needed it most</li>
                    <li>The Hawley-Smoot Tariff of 1930, which Hoover signed, raised tariffs and further reduced international trade, worsening the Depression</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>4. The Bonus Army Incident</h3>
                <p>In 1932, about 20,000 World War I veterans marched to Washington, D.C., demanding early payment of bonuses promised for 1945. Hoover ordered the army to disperse them, and troops led by General Douglas MacArthur used tear gas and burned the veterans' camp. This incident further damaged Hoover's reputation and helped ensure his defeat in the 1932 election.</p>

                <div class="key-points">
                    <h3>Exam Application</h3>
                    <p>For 12-16 mark questions about Hoover's response, consider both sides of the argument. While his measures were inadequate, historians debate whether any president could have done much better given the prevailing economic theories of the time and the unprecedented nature of the Depression. Compare his approach with FDR's later New Deal to highlight the differences in philosophy and scale.</p>

                <h2>Key Historical Interpretations</h2>
                <p>Historians have offered various interpretations of the causes and nature of the Great Depression:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Monetarist view (Milton Friedman):</strong> Argues that the Federal Reserve's failures to prevent banking collapses and maintain the money supply turned a recession into a depression</li>
                    <li><strong>Keynesian view:</strong> Emphasizes inadequate demand due to inequality and the need for government spending to stimulate the economy</li>
                    <li><strong>Structural view:</strong> Points to fundamental imbalances in the economy, including overproduction and weak agricultural sector</li>
                    <li><strong>International perspective:</strong> Stresses the role of international factors, including war debts, reparations, and the gold standard</li>
                </ul>

                <h2>Assessment Focus</h2>
