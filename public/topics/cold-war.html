                <h2>Origins of the Cold War (1945-1947)</h2>
                <p>The Cold War emerged from the ashes of World War II as former allies—the United States and Soviet Union—became rivals for global influence. Despite fighting together against Nazi Germany, these superpowers had fundamentally different political, economic, and ideological systems that led to growing mistrust and competition.</p>

                <div class="key-points">
                    <h3>Key Factors in the Origins of the Cold War</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Ideological Differences:</strong> American capitalism and democracy versus Soviet communism and authoritarianism</li>
                        <li><strong>Wartime Conferences:</strong> Growing tensions at Yalta (February 1945) and Potsdam (July-August 1945) over the post-war order</li>
                        <li><strong>Soviet Control of Eastern Europe:</strong> Stalin established communist governments in Poland, Hungary, Bulgaria, and other Eastern European countries</li>
                        <li><strong>Atomic Monopoly:</strong> American possession of nuclear weapons initially gave the US strategic advantage</li>
                        <li><strong>Security Concerns:</strong> Soviet fear of invasion after suffering 27 million deaths in World War II; American fear of communist expansion</li>
                    </ul>
                </div>

                </div>

                <h2>Containment and the Truman Doctrine (1947-1949)</h2>
                <p>By 1947, the cooperation of the war years had transformed into open rivalry. The United States developed a policy of "containment"—preventing the further spread of communism—which guided American foreign policy for decades.</p>

                    <h3>Key Policies and Events</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Truman Doctrine (March 1947):</strong> Promised American support to "free peoples" resisting "subjugation," initially providing aid to Greece and Turkey</li>
                        <li><strong>Marshall Plan (1948-1952):</strong> Provided over $13 billion in economic aid to rebuild Western Europe and create strong allies against communism</li>
                        <li><strong>Berlin Blockade and Airlift (1948-1949):</strong> Soviet blockade of West Berlin led to a massive American-led airlift of supplies</li>
                        <li><strong>NATO (1949):</strong> North Atlantic Treaty Organization formed as a military alliance against potential Soviet aggression</li>
                        <li><strong>Soviet Atomic Bomb (1949):</strong> The USSR successfully tested its first nuclear weapon, ending the American monopoly</li>

                <h2>The Korean War (1950-1953)</h2>
                <p>The Cold War turned hot in Korea when North Korean troops, backed by the Soviet Union and China, invaded South Korea in June 1950. President Truman, viewing this as a test of containment, committed American forces under UN authorization to defend South Korea.</p>

                <h2>McCarthyism and the Red Scare (1950-1954)</h2>
                <p>As the Cold War intensified abroad, fear of communist infiltration grew at home. Senator Joseph McCarthy exploited these fears, claiming to have lists of communists working in the State Department and other government agencies. Though he never substantiated his claims, his accusations ruined many careers and created a climate of suspicion.</p>

                    <h3>Exam Focus: Historical Interpretations</h3>
                    <p>The origins of the Cold War remain debated among historians. Traditional/Orthodox historians (1950s-60s) blamed Soviet expansionism, while Revisionist historians (1960s-70s) emphasized American economic imperialism. Post-revisionist historians (1970s-present) recognize both sides' contributions to the conflict and stress miscommunication and mutual fear. Post-Cold War scholarship using Soviet archives has provided new insights into Stalin's decision-making. For high marks, acknowledge these different interpretations in your answers.</p>

                <h2>Eisenhower and the Nuclear Arms Race (1953-1961)</h2>
                <p>President Dwight D. Eisenhower's administration continued containment policies while expanding America's nuclear arsenal. Eisenhower's "New Look" policy emphasized nuclear deterrence as a cost-effective alternative to maintaining large conventional forces.</p>

                <div class="key-points">
                    <h3>Key Developments Under Eisenhower</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>"New Look" Policy:</strong> Relied on nuclear weapons and the threat of "massive retaliation" to deter communist aggression</li>
                        <li><strong>Brinkmanship:</strong> Willingness to go to the brink of war to achieve objectives</li>
                        <li><strong>CIA Covert Operations:</strong> Secret interventions in Iran (1953) and Guatemala (1954) to overthrow governments perceived as pro-communist</li>
                        <li><strong>Domino Theory:</strong> Belief that if one nation fell to communism, neighboring states would follow</li>
                        <li><strong>Interstate Highway System:</strong> Built partly for national defense to evacuate cities and move military equipment</li>

                <h2>The Nuclear Arms Race</h2>
                <p>Both superpowers rapidly developed and expanded their nuclear arsenals, creating the doctrine of Mutual Assured Destruction (MAD)—the idea that neither side would attack because both would be destroyed in the ensuing nuclear exchange.</p>
